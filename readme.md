Local development
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Edit content, project links, and the contact form action (e.g., replace the Formspree action with your Formspree endpoint).

Contact form
- The form currently uses a placeholder Formspree action: `https://formspree.io/f/your-id`.
- To receive submissions, sign up at https://formspree.io (or another form provider) and replace the `action` attribute on the `<form>` element with your form endpoint.

Notes & recommended next steps
- Replace the Formspree placeholder with a real endpoint (or use Netlify Forms, FormKeep, or a server endpoint if you prefer).
- Add an OG image for social sharing.
- Add ArXiv and AMS MRLookup links in the Research section if you want direct links.
